    Dashboard Project

    This is a partial for the view of a project on the the RE-volv dashboard (mockup can be seen at
    https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7706852/6608266/b4c8fdd8-c802-11e4-9610-939a5f9f5dd9.png).
    This partial accepts the following template variables:

    :project: the project to render. Various things about the project will be renedered, including controls
        to approve/edit/complete the project, based on the permissions of the user.
    :user: the currently logged in user. This user is guaranteed to be logged in, since if they're
        seeing this page then they have bypassed the functionality which redirects to the homepage for
        unauthenticated users.

    The project view includes (1) a top bar with the title of the project, its status, and control buttons, (2)
    the cover photo of the project, and (3) a tabbed area with more into realted to the project in each tab,
    including management functions if the user has the appropriate permissions.

    TODO: currently, we load in the html for every single project in the RE-volv database on the admin dashboard
    page (on the donor and ambassador pages, we technically may load in some or all of them). When RE-volv grows
    beyond the order of 10-100 projects, this page may become very slow to load and/or a lot to work through
    easily in the sidebar UI, so we may have to rethink this design a little bit.
